#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u>   
Step 1: Set up the apparatus: To draw the B-H curve, you will need a magnetic field tester, a specimen in the form of a transformer, and a graphical representation software such as Microsoft Excel.<br><br>
Step 2: Determine the magnetic field strength: The magnetic field strength should be varied in small increments (e.g. 1 mT) and the magnetic flux density (B) should be measured at each magnetic field strength value. The process should be repeated in both increasing and decreasing magnetic field strength to produce a loop.<br><br>
Step 3: Plot the B-H curve: Plot the magnetic field strength (H) on the x-axis and the magnetic flux density (B) on the y-axis. Draw a line connecting the points in increasing and decreasing magnetic field strength to produce a loop, also known as the B-H curve.<br><br>
Step 4: Determine the hysteresis loss: The hysteresis loss can be calculated by finding the area enclosed by the B-H loop and multiplying it by the frequency of the magnetic field. The hysteresis loss formula can be represented as:<br>
Hysteresis Loss = A * f * B * H * n<br><br>
Where A is the cross-sectional area of the specimen, f is the frequency of the magnetic field, n is the number of turns in the specimen, B is the magnetic flux density, and H is the magnetic field strength.<br><br>
Step 5: Interpret the results: A low hysteresis loss means the material has low energy loss due to magnetic hysteresis and is desirable in transformer applications. A large hysteresis loss indicates a high energy loss and is less desirable in transformer applications.<br><br>

Note: The above steps are a general guideline and may vary slightly depending on the type of equipment used and the type of specimen being tested.<br>
###### Assessment Method: 
The assessment method of drawing the hysteresis (B-H) curve of a specimen in the form of a transformer and determining its hysteresis loss involves the following steps:<br><br>
1. Preparation: The specimen must be carefully prepared and placed in the experimental setup. The specimen should be a suitable size and shape, and the leads should be properly connected to the measurement equipment.<br>
2. Data collection: A waveform generator is used to generate a sinusoidal voltage waveform, which is applied to the primary winding of the transformer. The waveform generator is set to vary the frequency and amplitude of the waveform, and the magnetic field strength is measured using a Gaussmeter or an AC voltage probe.<br>
3. Plotting the B-H curve: The magnetic field strength is plotted against the magnetic flux density for each frequency. The resulting curve is the hysteresis (B-H) curve of the specimen.<br>
4. Determining the hysteresis loss: The hysteresis loss can be calculated using the area enclosed by the hysteresis curve, which is proportional to the energy lost due to hysteresis in the specimen. The hysteresis loss can be expressed as the product of the frequency, the area enclosed by the curve, and the magnetic permeability of the specimen.<br>
5. Repeat the measurement: Repeat the measurement at different frequencies and plot the B-H curve for each frequency to obtain the complete picture of the hysteresis behavior of the specimen.<br>
6. Analysis: The hysteresis loss can be compared with other specimens and analyzed to determine the effectiveness of different materials and structures in reducing hysteresis losses.<br>
7. Conclusion: The hysteresis (B-H) curve provides important information about the magnetic properties of the specimen and the energy losses due to hysteresis. The results of this assessment can be used to optimize the design and performance of transformers and other magnetic components.<br>
    
<u> <b>Description: </b>    </u>
<br>
Hysteresis loss refers to the energy loss in a magnetic material due to the repeated magnetization and demagnetization process. It is calculated as the area enclosed by the B-H (magnetic induction-magnetic field strength) curve. To draw the hysteresis curve of a transformer specimen, the following steps should be followed:<br>
1. Prepare the specimen: Cut the specimen into a specific size and shape suitable for measurement.<br>
2. Measure magnetic field strength (H): Apply a magnetic field of increasing strength to the specimen, and measure the magnetic induction (B) using a gaussmeter.<br>
3. Plot the B-H curve: Plot the magnetic induction (B) against the magnetic field strength (H) for both the increasing and decreasing magnetic field.<br>
4. Determine the hysteresis loss: Calculate the area enclosed by the B-H curve, which represents the hysteresis loss. The hysteresis loss can be determined using the formula: Hysteresis Loss = Area enclosed by the B-H curve x frequency of magnetization and demagnetization.<br>

By repeating the above steps at different frequencies, the effect of frequency on the hysteresis loss can be studied. Understanding the hysteresis loss helps in the design and optimization of transformers, making them more efficient.
