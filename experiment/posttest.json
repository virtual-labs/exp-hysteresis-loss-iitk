      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! The area of the loop (5 cm²) needs to be converted into actual energy using the scale factors: Energy = Area × scale factor for H × scale factor for B. The frequency of 50 Hz is then used to find total hysteresis loss: Hysteresis loss = Energy × frequency. Refer <a href='https://www.electrical4u.com/hysteresis-loss/'>here</a> for details.",
