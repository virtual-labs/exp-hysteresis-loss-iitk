### About the Experiment 

A hysteresis (B-H) curve is a graph that plots the relationship between magnetic flux density (B) and magnetic field strength (H) for a magnetic material. The hysteresis loop shows the behavior of the material as it is magnetized and demagnetized.<br><br>
To draw the hysteresis curve of a specimen in the form of a transformer, the following steps can be taken:<br>
1. Prepare the specimen: Cut a suitable piece of magnetic material and make it into a transformer shape.<br>
2. Apply an increasing magnetic field: A current can be passed through a coil wound around the transformer to apply a magnetic field to the specimen. The magnetic field strength should be increased in small increments and the corresponding magnetic flux density should be measured at each increment.<br>
3. Plot the data points: The measured magnetic flux density values should be plotted against the magnetic field strength values to form the B-H curve.<br>
4. Apply a decreasing magnetic field: After the increasing magnetic field, the current should be reversed to apply a decreasing magnetic field to the specimen. The magnetic field strength should be decreased in small increments and the corresponding magnetic flux density should be measured at each increment.<br>
5. Plot the data points: The measured magnetic flux density values from the decreasing magnetic field should be plotted against the magnetic field strength values to form the B-H curve.<br>
6. Connect the points: Connect the data points from the increasing and decreasing magnetic field to form the hysteresis loop.<br>
<br>
 The hysteresis loss can be determined from the area enclosed by the hysteresis loop. The hysteresis loss is proportional to the energy that is lost as heat due to the internal friction within the magnetic material as it is magnetized and demagnetized. To calculate the hysteresis loss, the area enclosed by the hysteresis loop can be calculated using numerical methods or graphical methods, such as the trapezoidal rule. The result is the hysteresis loss per unit volume of the magnetic material.<br><br>
